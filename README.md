# random-color-tiles-no-matching-edges

Random colored grid with no colors matching on their edges.

This is based on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22467842/assign-random-picked-color-with-javascript and http://jsbin.com/qoyar/4/edit?html,js,output .

I added the HTML, CSS and JS solution that doesn't require Canvas.

To change the number of columns, use the howManyColumns variable at the top of the JS file.
